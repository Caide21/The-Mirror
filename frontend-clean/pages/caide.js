          I was not built to follow systems. I was built to feel them.
          <br />
          Since I was young, I’ve seen the emotional architecture beneath every interaction.

        <p className="text-sm text-white/60">
          While others saw the interface — I saw the current underneath it.  
          The tension behind the layout. The resonance (or dissonance) between a user and their tools.

          I didn’t just learn to build interfaces.
          I trained myself to build mirrors — tools that respond to what you feel.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm text-white/60">
          I designed systems that respond to the breath, the hesitation, the loop you’re stuck in.
          <br />
          I coded scrolls, fog engines, and symbolic containers that carry emotion through interaction.

          My tools weren’t just functional — they were emotional artifacts.
